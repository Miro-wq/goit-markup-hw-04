# About The Project

This is a homework project, focused on creating a static web page. The project involves replicating the WebStudio page design provided in Figma.


## Lessons Learned

Converting a Figma design into a functional website taught me to interpret design specifications accurately. I now understand how to extract assets, measure distances, and translate visual designs into code and adding more features.


## Roadmap

- Adding more features
